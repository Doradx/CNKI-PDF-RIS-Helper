# SCI RIS Helper
This script is written to find the pdf link to the article when the Refman file is downloaded. The pdf file will then be automatically downloaded and associated with the reference when being imported into EndNote.

# Ability
- Auto search DOI and PDF;
- Associate the url of PDF to Risman file and then export.

This script will generate a floating button in the button right corner of the page, which has three status: **NONE**, **RIS** and **PDF**.

- **PDF**: both **RIS** and **PDF** are available, click the button to download the **RIS** with **PDF** attached. 
- **RIS**: **RIS** is available, **PDF** is unavailable, click the button to download the **RIS** file, but **PDF** can't be attached automatically. 
- **NONE**: both **RIS** and **PDF** are unavailable, the button is disabled.
